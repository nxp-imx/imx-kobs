//! This structure defines the NAND Control Block (NCB).  This block
//! contains information describing the timing for the NAND, the number of
//! NANDs in the system, the block size of the NAND, the page size of the NAND,
//! and other criteria for the NAND.  This is information that is
//! required just to successfully communicate with the NAND.
//! This structure also defines the Logical Drive Layout Block (LDLB).  This
//! block contains information describing the version as well as the layout of
//! the code and data on the NAND Media.  For the ROM, we're only concerned
//! with the boot firmware start.  Additional information may be stored in
//! the Reserved3 area.  This area will be of interest to the SDK.
//! This structure also defines the Discovered Bad Block Table (DBBT) header.
//! This block contains the information used for parsing the bad block tables
//! which are stored in subsequent 2K sectors.  The DBBT header is 8K, followed
//! by the first NANDs entries, then the 2nd NANDs entries on a subsequent 2K
//! page (determined by how many 2K pages the first nand requires), and so on.
